# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Detection

Overview

This project implements a real-time sign language detection system using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system accurately predicts and interprets sign language gestures from live webcam input, leveraging a custom-trained object detection model based on TensorFlowâ€™s Object Detection API.

Features

Real-time gesture detection using a webcam.
Custom dataset of gesture images collected and labeled with Labelimg.
Transfer learning applied to a Single Shot Detector (SSD) model for efficient object detection.
Integration with OpenCV for live video processing.
Achieves high accuracy and low-latency in gesture prediction.

Tech Stack

- Python  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- TensorFlow Object Detection API  
- OpenCV  
- LabelImg (for dataset labeling)  
- SSD MobileNet (pre-trained base model)
